## REQUIREMENTS

To write C programs in VS it must be installed Visual Studio (2022 or less), with:

- Developing tools for the desktop with C++
- If you want portability to Linux, install Linux Development with C++

To run C instead of C++, you create an empty C++ project, and in the Source Files folder, you add the C files. Visual Studio understands that it is C and not C++ (see image).

> To obtain the maximum performance, the program must be run in Release mode.
